Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers. Breakpoints can be enabled, disabled, or removed by right-clicking on them.
Step Over, Step Into, Step Out:

Step Over (F10): Executes the next line of code, but doesn't step into any functions.
Step Into (F11): Steps into the function call on the current line.
Step Out (Shift + F11): Steps out of the current function.
Variables View:

Displays the current value of variables in different scopes (local, global, etc.).
Watch Expressions:

Allows you to add expressions you want to monitor. You can see their values change as you step through your code.
Call Stack:

Shows the call stack and lets you navigate through the stack frames. This helps to understand the sequence of function calls that led to the current point.
Debug Console:

Allows you to evaluate expressions and execute commands in the context of the program being debugged.
Conditional Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints that only trigger when a specified condition is true. Right-click on a breakpoint and select "Edit Breakpoint" to add a condition.
Logpoints:

Instead of pausing the execution, logpoints log a message to the Debug Console. Right-click on the gutter and select "Add Logpoint."
Inline Values:

Shows variable values inline with the code during a debugging session.
